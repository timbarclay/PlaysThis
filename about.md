This site finds out what gear musicians use to get their work done and their music made. We try to go beyond what you can find out from an official gear manufacturer website and find out what tools and tricks help each musician do what they do and be who they are.

### About the site

This site is heavily influenced by [UsesThis.com](https://usesthis.com/).

Hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/timbarclay/PlaysThis) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
