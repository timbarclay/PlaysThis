This site finds out what gear musicians use to get their work done and their music made. We try to go beyond what you can find out from an official gear manufacturer website and find out what tools and tricks help each musician be productive.

### About the site

This site is heavily influenced by [UsesThis.com](https://usesthis.com/).

Hosted on [Github](https://github.com/timbarclay/PlaysThis), using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and based on [JekyllNow](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
