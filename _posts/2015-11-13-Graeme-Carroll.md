### Who are you and what do you do?

I'm Graeme Carroll, keyboard player with [Deep Purple in Rock](http://www.deeppurpleinrock.co.uk/), [Heaven Or Hell](https://www.facebook.com/Heavenorhellband/) and an as yet un-named Rainbow tribute. I am also mandolin player with [Brother Crow](http://www.brothercrow.co.uk/), an acoustic folk duo with a couple of CDs out!

### What do you use?

Stage Keyboards (I don't always use everything 'cos of space on stage):

* [Korg Kronos 2-88](http://www.andertons.co.uk/synths-amp-workstations/pid36610/cid619/korg-kronos-2-88-key-synthesizer-38-workstation.asp)
* [Access Virus TI-61](http://www.virus.info/virusti/overview)
* [Korg BX3](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/keyboards-midi/korg-bx3-dual-manual-organ) Organ (Digital)
* USB Midi Controller (connects to the Kronos)
* iPad/[iRig Pro](http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigpro/) and [Focusrite iTrack Dock](http://us.focusrite.com/ios-audio-interfaces/itrack-dock) (with [Minimoog](http://www.arturia.com/products/ipad-synths/imini) and [Sampletank](http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/cat-view.php?C=family-sampletank) software)
* [Alesis](http://www.alesis.com/en/index.php) Mixing Desk (I have 8 and 16 Channel Desks)
* [EV ELX112p](http://www.electrovoice.com/product.php?id=1066) Monitors

I'm slowly cutting the gear down and programming the Kronos, eventually I hope to use just the Kronos and a USB Controller for gigs. The Kronos contains the full Korg CX3/BX3 organ engine (amongst other things), so I will only use the BX3 for bigger gigs in the future as it takes up too much room on stage for the smaller ones.

### What would be your dream set up?

Already happy with my set up, only maybe a real [Hammond B3](http://theatreorgans.com/grounds/docs/history.html) and [Minimoog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimoog) would be added!
