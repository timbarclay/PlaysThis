### Who are you and what do you do? 

Hi! My name is Linzey Rae and I am the vocalist of [The Anchor](http://www.facebook.com/theanchorband), a metalcore band based out of Denver, CO. 

We have been around for about 3 years now and just released a [new single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpgolIYQHEA) called Greenbow County! You can buy it off [iTunes](http://apple.co/1pRw9KH) and [Amazon](http://amzn.to/1N9OUVe). It is also available on Google Play and Spotify! We are super excited to announce that we are in the studio currently recording a first full length, set to release in fall 2016.

I played guitar/bass for 8 years and have been self teaching myself vocals for 6.

I have been performing in bands since I was 12 years-old and have been with [The Anchor](http://www.theanchor-band.com) for the full 3 years...

I recently started a [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/c/LinzeyRae), which had [a video, called Metal Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwksxDHNoAE), go viral in January. You can find other videos on my channel including [more Metal Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNEcIWZpGeM), [original music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb3KUg68Ubg), [pop covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skwklrSkqBE), vocal covers, and other silly videos if you need a good laugh.

### What do you use?

For live shows, I use a [EV N/D767a](http://goo.gl/A8DApJ). It is a dynamic supercardioid with awesome clarity. My favorite part about it is its super low handling noise, which makes it great for live performances. It’s been through a lot with me, but I love this mic! 

For the YouTube channel, we do all the audio and visual recordings ourselves. 

Our software includes:

* [Studio One 3 Recording Daw](http://studioone.presonus.com/)
* [Torpedo Cab Sim](http://www.two-notes.com/en/hardware/torpedo-cab/) 
* [Steven Slate Drums](http://www.stevenslatedrums.com/)

### What would be your dream set up?

Oh man...If you gave me all the money in the world, there would be a problem. 

I think the first thing I would want to buy is a [Shure SM58](http://mybook.to/shuresm58). They are freakin indestructible and sound amazing.  

As far as recording equipment goes, you never really know what you want until you buy something and realize you need something else to go with it. But the list we have so far is:

* [Mackie 8 Bus Mixer](http://www.andertons.co.uk/studio-mixers/pid12835/cid605/mackie-m328-32-channel-8-buss-mixing-console.asp)
* [Motu 24 I/O Audio Interface](http://www.motu.com/products/avb/24ai-24ao)
* Probably every single [Steven Slate Plugin](http://www.slatedigital.com/) he has ever made.
* A huge isolation booth and tons of square footage to record drums.
* [A rolly chair](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/categories/departments/workspaces/20652/). I still don’t have a stinking rolly chair.
