### Who are you and what do you do?

My name is Austin Burcham and I am drummer based out of Los Angeles, CA. I have been playing drums since my teenage years and moved to Hollywood, CA in 2008 to attend Musician’s Institute. I graduated from M.I. in 2010 with an Associate of Arts in Drumset Performance and began playing in a variety of bands around LA in genres ranging from rock to jazz to progressive metal.

I am currently focusing most of my efforts on creating content for [my YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/abbdrums) where I have a series of lessons called “Study The Greats,” which are advanced drum lessons based off performance examples from some of the best drummers of all time. The channel also has a variety of other videos such as drum covers, recording sessions, product reviews, and gear comparisons.

I also have a [website](http://www.abbdrums.com) where I offer remote studio drumming via online collaboration, along with personal lessons and pictures of all my drum gear/studio.
