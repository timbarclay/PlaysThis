### Who are you and what do you do? 

My name is Jeremy and I’m the guitarist for [Little Grim](https://www.facebook.com/littlegrimuk/), a South London alt/indie group. Think Stone Roses meets the Strokes meets 1970s funk and you’ll get a general idea of what we do – or check out our recently released single, [Sparks](http://amusicblogyea.com/2016/04/18/exclusive-video-premiere-little-grim-sparks/).

### What do you use?

My set-up is simple, partly because I’m a purist, and partly because I’m broke. So it consists of a [2001 Fender American Standard Stratocaster](http://intl.fender.com/en-GB/guitars/stratocaster/) going into a [Vox AC15](http://www.voxamps.com/ac15c1), with a few pedals in-between. The Vox, which was part of my set-up long before I got my first American guitar, completely opened up my sound. It’s capable of bell-like clean tones and has plenty of grit, too. It’s the perfect size for the size of venues we play. I’ve played through an [AC30](http://www.voxamps.com/ac30c2) before (which belongs to our drummer) but never found myself in a situation where I could really get the most out of it – like driving a Ferrari in Central London.
 
My Strat is a complete workhorse, and I treat it as such. I’m not too precious over it, and think any knocks and dinks that it’s earned on the road only make it look better. Sound-wise, it’s unmistakably a Strat. Being a slightly older model, its pick-ups aren’t so hot and I think it has quite a vintage sound which works for me.

In the studio I’ve used other guitars. Our first single, Vice, was recorded on an old [Ibanez](http://www.ibanez.com/) semi-hollow, as well as a gorgeous [Fender Deluxe Telecaster](http://intl.fender.com/en-GB/?cgid=fender-products-electric-model-platform-telecaster-deluxe) which was very hard to leave behind.
 
I can’t get enough of pedals – I even tried to make one once whilst at university, but my soldering skills weren’t up to scratch. I’d like to draw attention to a couple: The [Fulltone Plimsoul Overdrive](http://www.fulltone.com/products/plimsoul) pedal is a completely distinctive overdrive (and far more interesting than their more popular [OCD](http://www.fulltone.com/products/ocd)); and the [TC Electronic Hall of Fame reverb](http://www.tcelectronic.com/hall-of-fame-reverb/)  puts the spring in my Vox to shame.

### What would be your dream set up?

I’m surprised I haven’t been barred from my local guitar shop, I go in there so often just to try all my dream guitars and then leave without spending a penny. It changes every day, but at the moment I’m a big fan of the [1971 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS__lEj5eXQ) similar to the one used by Adam Granduciel from the War on Drugs. My ideal amp would probably be a [Fender Princeton](http://intl.fender.com/en-GB/amps/guitar-amplifiers/65-princeton-reverb-230v-eur/), although I’m not sure the two would go so well together.
