### Who are you and what do you do?

My name's Dave Lourie and I'm a  professional drummer/percussionist/teacher. I play in a variety of musical settings that include recording sessions, video sessions, large hall concerts, small club gigs, big band, pop, jazz, latin dance events  - the list goes on.

Just finished recording an EP called ['Flight'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auDV_s_-WS0) with '1975' sideman John Waugh - on [iTunes](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/album/flight-ep/id1041026561?mt=1&app=music) and have been recording album material with guitarist Phil Hudson.
Right now I'm rehearsing for a short run of shows from the writer of BBCs 'Hebburn', Jason Cook.

I also [teach](http://newcastledrumtuition.co.uk/) extensively in schools and colleges and from my own studio.

### What do you use?

Endorsed by [Yamaha drums](http://uk.yamaha.com/en/products/musical-instruments/drums/). I have a [Maple Custom Absolute](http://usa.yamaha.com/product_archive/drums/maple_custom_absolute/?mode=model) and a [Beech Custom Absolute](http://usa.yamaha.com/product_archive/drums/beech_custom_absolute/?mode=model).

Sticks, brushes and beaters by [Promark](http://www.promark.com/) (endorsee) - not model specific but I prefer the RB series.
Heads by [Evans](http://www.evansdrumheads.com/) (endorsee). Could be any combo but mostly single ply [G1s](http://evansdrumheads.com/EvProductDetail.Page?ActiveID=3567&productid=436&productname=G1_Clear&sid=38a047a5-1d16-49b5-a04b-11ae5c4fe70f). Also have a variety of vintage [Ludwig](http://www.ludwig-drums.com/) snares. [400s, 402s and Acrolites](http://www.mikedolbear.com/story.asp?StoryID=547&Source=Archive&txtSearch).

Cymbals - tons of them. Old [Zildjians](http://zildjian.com/), some [Sabians](http://www.sabian.com/en/home), [Dreams](http://www.dreamcymbals.com/) but  my favourites are my growing collection of [Meinl Byzance](http://meinlcymbals.com/cymbal-series/byzance-brilliant) cymbals. They are beautiful.

At my studio I record with [Cubase](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html) on Windows 7 with a bank of [MOTU 8pre DACs](http://www.motu.com/products/motuaudio/8pre) linked optically. I'm only concerned with input quality. I usually send stems off to the client and they'll do all the editing/mixing. I use a wide selection of mics - [AKG](http://uk.akg.com/akg-homepage-uk.html), [Shure](http://www.shure.co.uk/), [Sennheiser](http://en-uk.sennheiser.com/), [Se](http://www.seelectronics.com/se-microphones/). I'm currently loving the [Avantone Mondo](http://www.avantonepro.com/Avantone-MONDO-Dynamic-Kick-Drum-Microphone.html) bass drum mic - heavy! Monitoring on [M Audio](http://www.m-audio.com/) and using the [VF drummers headphones](http://www.vicfirth.com/products/headphones.php) and trusty [Beyer DT 150s](http://eastern-europe.beyerdynamic.com/shop/dt-150.html).

### What would be your dream set up?

I wouldn't spend any more on gear. I'd hire the best players possible on the projects that I was involved with.

The gear helps up to a point, but if it's not in your hands you won't find it in the equipment.
