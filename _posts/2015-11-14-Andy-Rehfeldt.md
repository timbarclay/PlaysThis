### Who are you and what do you do?

My name is [Andy Rehfeldt](http://www.andyrehfeldt.com/).  I am a composer at [Endless Noise](http://www.endlessnoise.com/) in Los Angeles.  I am best known for my YouTube channels, [Andy Rehfeldt](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndyRehfeldt) and [Wilton Turdley](https://www.youtube.com/user/WiltonTurdley) (also [here](https://vimeo.com/user14729802) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh91VOXtc1_J7GNWkqIbSJg)).

On YouTube, I create video dubs where I change the musical genre of famous bands and pop stars into something much more entertaining, in my opinion. I also play guitar at bar band gigs in Orange County and Los Angeles.

### What do you use?

I play [Fender](http://www.fender.com/) guitars, a [Yamaha](http://uk.yamaha.com/en/products/musical-instruments/guitars-basses/el-basses/) bass, a [Squire](http://www.squierguitars.com/) bass, whatever keyboards are available, and a fart piano from Walmart.

At Endless Noise, I record with state of the art gear.  But at home, where I do most of my video dubs, I use an old [Mac G4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4) with [Protools LE](http://www.avid.com/UK/products/family/Pro-Tools) software, and a [Line 6 Pod](http://uk.line6.com/pod/) for guitar.  For midi drums, I use an [Alesis DM5](http://www.alesis.com/dm5), and my fans complain about the cymbals, understandably. For keyboard sounds, I have an [EMU Proteus](http://www.vintagesynth.com/emu/proteus.php) and Super Lead, vintage gear adored by not many.

For bass, I use an [MXR](http://www.jimdunlop.com/product/m80-bass-di) bass DI pedal.  I also have a [Zoom](https://www.zoom.co.jp/) portable recorder that I record my farts with, in order to create my Fartstep videos, which I am proud to be a pioneer of!

### What would be your dream set up?

My set up would be the most powerful Mac, stocked with [Kontact](http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-5/), [Easy Drummer](https://www.toontrack.com/product/ezdrummer-2/), [Guitar Rig](http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/guitar/guitar-rig-5-pro/), [Massive](http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths/massive/), [Vienna Instruments](https://www.vsl.co.at/en/Products/Instruments#!Instruments_Overview) (cringe) etcâ€¦

For guitars, I would have a [Gibson SG](http://www.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/SG.aspx) again, and I would have a great [P Bass](http://intl.fender.com/en-GB/basses/precision-bass/). For keyboards, I would have an 88 key weighted midi controller. For live gigs, I would have 10 [Marshall](https://marshallamps.com/) stacks, and a truck driver to drive them to my bar gigs.
