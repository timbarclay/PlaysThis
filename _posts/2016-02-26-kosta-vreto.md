### Who are you and what do you do? 

I am Kosta Vreto, guitar player and composer of [Wardrum](http://wardrum.gr/) (albums: Spadework, Desolation, Messenger) and [Jaded Star](http://www.jadedstar.net/) (Memories From The Future), running a solo project as well (Skin On Strings, Pictures Of A Broken Heart). Beside all of these, I teach guitar, do guitar clinics, some session work and work as a producer and mixing engineer for bands!

### What do you use?

Well let's start from the guitars! I use two hand made guitars by an amazing luthier from my hometown Thessaloniki, [George Papazoglou](https://www.facebook.com/George-Papazoglou-Dr-Fret-112610782118798/). My main axe is my purple  guitar (mahogany with maple top and maple fretboard, two humbuckers which I can split) and the other one is a Superstrat replica (ash, maple and ebony). I do use, depending on the sound I want to get, a [Cort](http://www.cortguitars.com/) and a [Tradition](http://www.traditionguitars.com/) guitar as well! My acoustic guitar is a [Ovation](http://www.ovationguitars.com/) and a [Olympus](http://olympuscustomguitars.wix.com/olympuscustomguitars) classical guitar.

My amp is a [Telegun Hell Boy](https://www.facebook.com/TeleGun-Amps-201340816546380/) (hand made as well). I have to say that I'm in love with this amp. I love the versatility of it. I can take it with me on any gig, from rock to metal style. The best feature I think is the rich sound and the ability to "listen" to the player as well!

My pedalboard consists of a variety of [Telegun](https://www.facebook.com/TeleGun-Amps-201340816546380/) pedals as well for the distorted sounds, an [Ibanez tube screamer](http://www.andertons.co.uk/compact-pedals/pid9948/cid692/ibanez-ts9-tube-screamer-overdrive-pedal.asp), [Boss](http://www.bossus.com/) pedals for delays, EQ's and acoustic simulations and a [Rocktron Tsunami](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/chorus-flanger-phaser-effects-pedals/rocktron-tsunami-chorus-pedal) chorus pedal. To be honest I'm not a huge fun of wah but still I own a [cry baby](http://www.jimdunlop.com/product/cry-baby) pedal!

As far as the studio is conserned, I love to work on [Logic](http://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/) and use a [Motu](http://www.motu.com/) and [Mackie](http://mackie.com/) sound card. So either for messing around or producing an album, I tend to rely on [Logic](http://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/) (maybe way too much hahaha). Beside the amps and guitars I own, in the studio I have a variety of other amps ([Marshall](https://marshallamps.com/), [Peavey](http://peavey.com/), [Bugera](https://www.music-group.com/brand/bugera/home)...) and cabinets ([Laney](http://www.laney.co.uk/), [Boogie](http://www.mesaboogie.com/), [Engl](http://www.englamps.de/)..) for recording purposes...

### What would be your dream set up?

It all depends on the genre of music you have to play. For example, a metal setup would be my purple guitar, a [tube screamer](http://www.andertons.co.uk/compact-pedals/pid9948/cid692/ibanez-ts9-tube-screamer-overdrive-pedal.asp) into the [Hell Boy](https://www.facebook.com/TeleGun-Amps-201340816546380/) or a [5150](http://www.evhgear.com/en-GB/gear/amps/) straight to a [Boogie](http://www.mesaboogie.com/) 4x12 cab. A more rock approach would be my Strat into The [Hell Boy](https://www.facebook.com/TeleGun-Amps-201340816546380/) or a [Marshall Plexi](https://marshallamps.com/products/amplifiers/vintage-re-issues/1959slp/) straight to an [Engl](http://www.englamps.de/) cab. But you know that this is a very tough question to answer. Still I think I came as close to it as I could!!!
